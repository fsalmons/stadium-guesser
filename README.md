# üèüÔ∏è Stadium Guesser

A real-time multiplayer geo-guessing game where players guess stadium locations for points!

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd stadium-guesser

```

### 2. Add Stadium Images
Place your stadium images in `public/images/stadiums/` with these names (in order of difficulty):
- tottenham.jpeg
- allianz.jpg
- camp-nou.jpg
- bernabeu.jpg
- old-trafford.jpg
- san-siro.jpg
- signal-iduna.jpg
- maracana.jpg
- azteca.jpg
- bombonera.jpg

**Important:** Make sure all 10 images are added before starting the game!

### 3. Start Server
```bash
npm start
```

The server will display:
- Local URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Network URL: `http://YOUR_IP:3000` (for other devices on your network)

### 4. Play the Game

**As Host:**
1. Open: `http://localhost:3000?host=true`
2. Enter your name and join
3. Use the host controls (top-right) to:
   - Start Round

   - Next Round

**As Players:**
1. Share the network URL with players: `http://YOUR_IP:3000`
2. Everyone enters their name to join
